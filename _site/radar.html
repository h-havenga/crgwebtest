    <h1 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h1>
<p>The NWU Lekwena radar is a test bed for students to learn and develop creative
solutions related to weather forecasting and now-casting. This means that the
Radar can be switched off for maintenance or it could be broken on purpose in
the name of learning. The radar should not be used as a tool to make any severe
weather alerts in the name of the Lekwena Radar as the South-African Weather
Service is the only credible institution to do this. The radar should only be
viewed as a tool for the development of young scientists and something
interesting to look at.</p>

here</a> or scroll to the bottom of the page</p>

<h3 id="time">Time</h3>
<p>The radar is set to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and not South African
Standard Time (SAST). To correct for this you need to add two hours to the time
as indicated below, for example 12:04 UTC + 2 Hours = 14:04 SAST.</p>

<h3 id="reflectivity-dbz">Reflectivity (dBZ)</h3>
<p>In the most basic terms a radar’s operation consists of a high frequency signal
pulse that’s generated from the site, the signal echo’s when it interacts with
large particles such as hail or raindrops and a receiver that converts
the echo into something human interpretable. This echo is represented as
<em>decibel relative to Z</em> or dBZ. Strong dBZ means there are large particles producing
a strong echo, this would be large rain, hail or ice particles in clouds.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/radar/RadarDBZ.png" alt="radar_bdz" /></p>

<h3 id="interference">Interference</h3>
<p>The NWU Lekwena Radar has an license to operate on a certain spectrum, any
other networks that are on this spectrum unknowingly cause the interference seen
on the image, impacting the quality of data. The radar operates on the 5.6 gHz
bandwidth and any WiFi or communication network between 5.55 gHz and 5.67 gHz
causes problems and hampers research. The public is also encouraged not to use
this bandwidth in the Potchefstroom area and the NWU-CRG is willing to help
service providers mitigate these risks by advising on the installation of
Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) devices as required by law. Users can also
contact their service providers to learn more about the frequency of their
devices and how to avoid interference with the NWU Lekwena Radar.</p>

<h3 id="places-indicators">Places Indicators</h3>
<p>The radar indicates towns with abbreviations and also some regional airports in
the Gauteng Area with the Airplane sign. The little cloud sign indicates
the location of the SAWS Irene Weather station. The circular lines indicate the distance
of from the radar site, which is a maximum of 200km due to various factors such as the
curvature of the earth</p>
