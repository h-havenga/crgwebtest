# Disclaimer
The NWU Lekwena radar is a test bed for students to learn and develop creative
solutions related to weather forecasting and now-casting. This means that the
Radar can be switched off for maintenance or it could be broken on purpose in
the name of learning. The radar should not be used as a tool to make any severe
weather alerts in the name of the Lekwena Radar as the South-African Weather
Service is the only credible institution to do this. The radar should only be
viewed as a tool for the development of young scientists and something
interesting to look at.
